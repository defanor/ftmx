# FT M-x #

Command search and execution, inspired by atom's "command palette".

Full text search is applied to find the input among function names,
and if that fails, it searches in both names and docstrings.


## Installation ##

1. `git clone https://github.com/defanor/ftmx.git`
2. `M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/ftmx.el RET`

Alternatively, the regular `load-path` setting and `(require 'ftmx)`,
with [EmacSQL](https://github.com/skeeto/emacsql) (with the
emacsql-sqlite backend if it comes from melpa) and
[seq.el](https://github.com/NicolasPetton/seq.el) installed.


## Usage ##

It's intended to be similar to `M-x`, just with full text search
(hence "FT M-x"). `C-n` and `C-p` can be used to rotate the search
results.

To invoke it, either use `M-x ftmx` or bind it to a key,
e.g. `(global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'ftmx)`.

`ftmx-init` can be called manually to (re)initialize the command
database; otherwise it gets initialized on the first `ftmx`
invocation.


## Example ##

```
ftmx: |
ftmx: org|
ftmx: org | {org-columns-remove-overlays*: Remove all currently active column overlays.}
ftmx: org minor | {*orgstruct-mode*: Toggle the minor mode `orgstruct-mode'.}
```

And with more of org loaded:

```
ftmx: org minor | {org-src-mode*: Minor mode for language major mode buffers generated by Org.}
C-n
ftmx: org minor | {orgstruct-mode*: Toggle the minor mode `orgstruct-mode'.}
C-p
ftmx: org minor | {org-src-mode*: Minor mode for language major mode buffers generated by Org.}
C-p
ftmx: org minor | {org-cdlatex-mode*: Toggle the minor `org-cdlatex-mode'.}
SPC

Possible completions are:
org-src-mode: Minor mode for language major mode buffers generated by Org.
orgstruct-mode: Toggle the minor mode `orgstruct-mode'.
orgtbl-mode: The `org-mode' table editor as a minor mode for use in other modes.
org-cdlatex-mode*: Toggle the minor `org-cdlatex-mode'.

ftmx: org minor table | {*orgtbl-mode*: The `org-mode' table editor as a minor mode for use in other modes.}
ftmx: org minor list | {*orgstruct-mode*: Toggle the minor mode `orgstruct-mode'.}
```
